COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

27.0,"Request for Proposals Elevating the Outdoors: A Regional Approach to Growing Western Maryland’s Outdoor Economy RFP release date: February 25, 2022 Responses due by: April 6, 2022 Allegany and Garrett counties in Maryland are working in collaboration with the State of Maryland Department of Commerce to develop a recruitment and strategic plan to attract outdoor recreation/lifestyle manufacturing to locate, expand, and grow in Western Maryland. I. Background: Allegany and Garrett counties are gateway communities, home to 148,000 acres of public land, 31% of the entire state’s owned acreage. With over 500 miles of developed trail systems, one National Park, three state forests, and 11 state parks, our region’s outdoor recreation economy and access to natural resources offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and community development. According to the Maryland Outdoor Recreation Economic (MORE) Commission report released in December 2019, outdoor recreation-related expenditures generated $14 billion in annual consumer spending and 109,000 direct jobs in Maryland. Nationwide, the outdoor economy numbers are equally impressive, with $787.6 billion in consumer spending, $5.2 million jobs, and $125 billion in federal, state, and local tax revenue. Stimulated by an experience-driven lifestyle, the population’s growing desire to access the outdoors for work and recreation has supported this industry. This became more readily apparent due to COVID-19 when the pandemic boosted the outdoor recreation industry in our counties. The MORE Commission developed innovative strategies to market Maryland’s unique outdoor and heritage recreation brand and recommended initiatives to grow and attract new companies. As part of the MORE Commission’s recommendations to enhance and strengthen the business climate in Maryland, they suggested this: “Develop a recruitment plan to attract outdoor lifestyle manufacturers, such as kayak, boat, bicycle, and ATV companies to locate and grow in Maryland. Showcase Maryland’s outdoor recreation lifestyle as an active recruitment tool when attracting non-recreational businesses to the state through the development of promotional materials for use by industry.” Both Allegany and Garrett counties share a common theme in being destinations that grew from the industrial revolution with roots steeped in coal, timber, and agriculture and the staging and outfitting point for westward migration. Like many other communities across the Appalachian region, as the coal economy declined, industries faded, jobs dissolved, and together our two counties have faced about a 6% decline in population over the last five years. One pathway forward is leveraging our regional natural assets. II. Opportunity: The project's goal is to transform Allegany and Garrett counties in Maryland into an outdoor recreation and lifestyle manufacturing hub. The project focuses on hiring a consulting team to produce a strategic and recruitment plan to provide three specific deliverables: ● a situational attraction analysis highlighting the development of an industry-specific compatibility matrix; ● a regional strategic plan for business attraction; ● the creation of an industry-focused, regional marketing/sales pitch packet. The plan’s implementation will empower Allegany and Garrett counties to create jobs, leverage private investment, and utilize its access to natural resources as a powerful marketing tool for economic development regionally and for the state of Maryland. III. Scope of Work: Exhibit A is a detailed scope of work. The selection committee looks to the Consultant Team to present a cost-effective fee proposal to complete the Scope of Work. The estimated schedule for completion of the scope of work is six months, which will allow time for scheduling, receiving, and incorporating input. IV.

Exhibit A: Scope of Work The following Scope of Work is provided to guide and not limit the Consultant Team. The Scope of Work outlined below is the minimum required. It is intended to produce a strategic and recruitment plan which will provide three specific deliverables: ● a situational attraction analysis highlighting the development of an industry-specific compatibility matrix; ● a regional strategic plan for business attraction, and the creation of an industry-focused; ● regional marketing/sales pitch packet.

In broad terms, we’re interested in attracting people from nearby urban areas by leaning into our Outdoor Recreation and Lifestyle opportunities. We want to provide a path to follow should they be interested in long-term connections to our region (starting/expanding a business, buying property, relocating to the area for employment, or working remotely for a current employer) or subsequent recreational visits (tourism, travel packages).

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

SUMMARY OF POLICY AND PROHIBITIONS ON PROCUREMENT LOBBYING: Pursuant to State Finance Law § 139-j and § 139-k, this Solicitation includes and imposes certain restrictions on communications between OGS and a Bidder during the procurement process. A Bidder is restricted from making contacts from the earliest posting, on a governmental entity’s website, in a newspaper of general circulation, or in the procurement opportunities newsletter of intent to solicit offers/Bids through final award and approval of the Procurement Contract by OGS and, if applicable, the Office of the State Comptroller (“restricted period”) to other than designated staff unless it is a contact that is included among certain statutory exceptions set forth in State Finance Law § 139- j(3)(a). Designated staff, as of the date hereof, are identified on the first page of this Solicitation and in the MWBE Designated Contacts, SDVOB Designated Contacts and Insurance Designated Contacts sections. OGS employees are also required to obtain certain information when contacted during the restricted period and make a determination of the responsibility of the Bidder pursuant to State Finance Law §139-j and §139-k. Certain findings of non-responsibility can result in rejection for Contract award and, in the event of two findings within a four-year period, the Bidder is debarred from obtaining governmental Procurement Contracts for four years. Further information about these requirements can be found on the OGS website at: https://www.ogs.ny.gov/acpl/ 2. NYS Vendor File Registration: Prior to being awarded a Contract pursuant to this Solicitation, the Bidder and any authorized resellers who accept payment directly from the State, must be registered in the New York State Vendor File (Vendor File) administered by the Office of the State Comptroller (OSC). This is a central registry for all vendors who do business with New York State Agencies and the registration must be initiated by a State Agency. Following the initial registration, a unique New York State ten-digit vendor identification number (Vendor ID) will be assigned to your company and to each of your authorized resellers (if any) for use on all future transactions with New York State. Additionally, the Vendor File enables a vendor to use the Vendor Self-Service application to manage all vendor information in one central location for all transactions related to the State of New York. If Bidder is already registered in the New York State Vendor File, the Bidder must enter its Vendor ID on the first page of this Solicitation. Authorized resellers already registered should list the Vendor ID number along with the authorized reseller information. (The Vendor ID number is not the same as a SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER or a TIN/FEIN number.) If the Bidder is not currently registered in the Vendor File, the Bidder must request assignment of a Vendor ID from OGS. Bidder must complete the OSC Substitute W-9 Form (http://www.osc.state.ny.us/vendors/forms/ac3237s_fe.pdf) and submit the form to OGS in advance of Bid submission. Please send this document to the Designated Contact identified in the Solicitation. In addition, if an authorized reseller is to be used that does not have a Vendor ID, an OSC Substitute W-9 form should be completed by each authorized reseller and submitted to OGS. OGS will initiate the vendor registration process for all Bidders and authorized resellers. Once the process is initiated, registrants will receive an e-mail identifying their Vendor ID and instructions on how to enroll in the online Vendor Self-Service application. For more information on the Vendor File please visit the following website: https://osc.state.ny.us/vendors/ 3. NYS VENDOR RESPONSIBILITY: OGS conducts a review of prospective Contractors (“Bidders”) to provide reasonable assurances that the Bidder is responsive and responsible. A For-Profit Business Entity Questionnaire (hereinafter “Questionnaire”) is used for non- construction Contracts and is designed to provide information to assess a Bidder’s responsibility to conduct business in New York based upon financial and organizational capacity, legal authority, business integrity, and past performance history. By submitting a Bid, Bidder agrees to fully and accurately complete the Questionnaire. The Bidder acknowledges that the State’s execution of the Contract will be contingent upon the State’s determination that the Bidder is responsible, and that the State will be relying upon the Bidder’s responses to the Questionnaire, in addition to all other information the State may obtain from other sources, when making its responsibility determination. OGS recommends each Bidder file the required Questionnaire online via the New York State VendRep System. To enroll in and use the VendRep System, please refer to the VendRep System Instructions and User Support for Vendors GROUP 05900 – NATURAL GAS (Firm & Interruptible Supply) PAGE 3 __________ available at the Office of the State Comptroller’s (OSC) website at http://www.osc.state.ny.us/vendors/index.htm or to enroll, go directly to the VendRep System online at https://www.osc.state.ny.us/state-vendors/vendrep/vendrep-system. Vendors must provide their New York State Vendor Identification Number when enrolling. For information on how to request assignment of a Vendor ID, see the NYS Vendor File Registration section. OSC provides direct support for the VendRep System through user assistance, documents, online help, and a help desk. The OSC Help Desk contact information is located at http://www.osc.state.ny.us/portal/contactbuss.htm. Bidders opting to complete and submit the paper questionnaire can access this form and associated definitions via the OSC website at http://www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/forms_vendor.htm. In order to assist the State in determining the responsibility of the Bidder prior to Contract award, the Bidder must complete and certify (or recertify) the Questionnaire no more than six (6) months prior to the Bid due date. A Bidder’s Questionnaire cannot be viewed by OGS until the Bidder has certified the Questionnaire. It is recommended that all Bidders become familiar with all of the requirements of the Questionnaire in advance of the Bid opening to provide sufficient time to complete the Questionnaire. The Bidder agrees that if it is awarded a Contract the following shall apply: The Contractor shall at all times during the Contract term remain responsible. The Contractor agrees, if requested by the Commissioner of OGS, to present evidence of its continuing legal authority to do business in New York State, integrity, experience, ability, prior performance, and organizational and financial capacity. The Commissioner of OGS, in his or her sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend any or all activities under this Contract, at any time, when he or she discovers information that calls into question the responsibility of the Contractor. In the event of such suspension, the Contractor will be given written notice outlining the particulars of such suspension. Upon issuance of such notice, the Contractor must comply with the terms of the suspension order. Contract activity may resume at such time as the Commissioner of OGS issues a written notice authorizing a resumption of performance under the Contract. The Contractor agrees that if it is found by the State that Contractor’s responses to the Questionnaire were intentionally false or intentionally incomplete, on such finding, the Commissioner may terminate the Contract. Upon written notice to the Contractor, and a reasonable opportunity to be heard with appropriate OGS officials or staff, the Contract may be terminated by the Commissioner of OGS at the Contractor’s expense where the Contractor is determined by the Commissioner of OGS to be non-responsible. In such event, the Commissioner of OGS may complete the contractual requirements in any manner he or she may deem advisable and pursue available legal or equitable remedies for breach. In no case shall such termination of the Contract by the State be deemed a breach thereof, nor shall the State be liable for any damages for lost profits or otherwise, which may be sustained by the Contractor as a result of such termination. All potential bidders must file a Vendor Responsibility Questionnaire no later than March 11, 2022. OGS prefers the questionnaire be filed electronically on-line; however, paper forms submitted with this intent to bid is acceptable.

If an entire insurance policy is submitted but not requested, OGS shall not be obligated to review and shall not be chargeable with knowledge of its contents.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

Right to Know (Section 4): ALCOSAN is a municipal authority and is therefore subject to requests through the Pennsylvania Right-To-Know Law (RTKL). Submittals may become part of a RTKL request during and after the subsequent contract. All Proposers shall clearly identify only that portion of the proposal, which is considered company proprietary information and, therefore, exempt under the RTKL.

RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required.

REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN.

ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity.

317.0,"1 ALLEGHENY COUNTY SANITARY AUTHORITY (ALCOSAN) REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS for PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OHIO RIVER TUNNEL FINAL DESIGN PROJECT S-485 March 24, 2021 1.0 Background The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (“ALCOSAN”) entered into a Consent Decree on January 24, 2008 with the U.S. EPA, Pennsylvania DEP and the Allegheny County Health Department to address Combined Sewer Overflows. A Modified Consent Decree was approved on May 14, 2020 to replace the 2008 Consent Decree. Copies of these documents are all available via ALCOSAN’s Website at the following location: https://www.alcosan.org/our- plan/plan-documents. ALCOSAN contracted with a professional engineering firm in 2017 to perform Preliminary Planning for the Regional tunnel system. Work undertaken in the program consisted of tunnel sizing and layout, surface structure configuration and layout, geotechnical investigation, hydraulic and surge analysis, and costing. The deliverable from this process is the Preliminary Basis of Design Report (BODR) which is available upon request from the Procurement Officer. This BODR was submitted to the Regulatory Agencies on October 1, 2020 for review and approval. 2.0 INTRODUCTION ALCOSAN is soliciting Letters of Interest and Statements of Qualification (collectively, “Submittals”) from Professional Engineering firms to perform the Ohio River Tunnel (ORT) Final Design Consulting (FDC) Services. The program will advance the work performed by the Preliminary Planning team to advance the Ohio River Tunnel (ORT), Chartiers Creek and Saw Mill Run Crossings, and associated dropshafts, regulators, outfall and consolidation sewers to a final design. The ORT FDC will perform final design for the ORT and the associated conveyance systems. The final designer will work closely with the Tunnel Program Manager (Tunnel PM) to coordinate future connections to Allegheny River Tunnel (ART), Monongahela River Tunnel (MRT) as well as the Wastewater Treatment Plant Expansion Program Manager (WWTP PM) and Tunnel Dewatering Pump Station Final Design Consultant for the downstream connection. 2 The starting point for the ORT designer will be the review of several Preliminary Planning reports and memoranda. The primary report is the Preliminary Basis of Design Report and drawings which represent approximately the 20% design stage, as submitted for agency review and approval. The prospective ORT FDCs will be provided the Preliminary Planning BODR report. The BODR report includes the Geotechnical Data Report (GDR) and Geotechnical Design Memorandum (GDM).

Submittals that do not include requested information and/or do not follow the requested format will be considered non- responsive. Non-responsive Submittals will not be evaluated. To enable ALCOSAN to efficiently evaluate the Submittals, Proposers must strictly follow the required format in preparing their Submittals. Each Submittal shall be organized in the following order: A. Letter of Commitment: Provide a cover letter and company profile introducing the firm. This letter shall commit the firm to the terms of this RFQ and shall be signed by a person authorized to bind the company. B. Outside Cover and/or First Page: Shall contain the name of the RFQ, the name of the Proposer, a point-of-contact, contact information (telephone and email) and the submittal date. C. Table of Contents D. Team’s Experience/References (Tabbed Section 1): The Proposer shall select five (5) similar projects using Part I, Section F, SF 330, to highlight, as best representing the Team’s project experience. Using the SF 330 format, the Proposer shall prepare a brief, two-page, summary of the project including the following information: • Project Name and Location • Date(s) of Project • Project Owner • Contact Name/Address/Telephone Number/Email Address • Description of the Project, identifying and highlighting the Proposer’s involvement. • Firm Name and Role • Key Personnel involved in the Project, including Subconsultants • Year Completed • Total Fees 7 E. Team’s Experience (Tabbed Section 2): The Proposer will submit a completed Form SF 330 (Parts I and II). The Proposer shall attach an 11x17 Organizational Chart (Part I, Section D) of the proposed Team, not to exceed one (1) page. The Proposer may provide no more than ten (10) resumes of key personnel for Part I, Section E, with each resume not exceeding two (2) pages. The resumes should be project based and not a chronological listing of employment. The resumes must be in the SF 330 format. The Proposer shall provide a matrix of the Projects identified in Section 1 and the team members, including subconsultants, participation on each project. F. Commitment to MBE/WBE/SDV Participation Goals (Tabbed Section 3): ALCOSAN encourages businesses owned and operated by minorities, disadvantaged, women, and service-disabled veteran business enterprises to submit Submittals or to participate as subconsultants or suppliers. The Proposer shall be required to utilize minority, disadvantaged, women (MBE) and service- disabled veteran (SDV) business enterprises to the fullest extent possible. The MBE/WBE participation goals are 10-25% of the total value of the Consultant’s proposed services. The SDV participation goals are 3% of this same total value. A copy of ALCOSAN’s Supplier Diversity Business Policy Statement is available on the ALCOSAN website. At this stage of submitting qualifications, ALCOSAN is looking for more than a general commitment to the goals of the policy. The companies must have a certification from a third party. The Service-Disabled Veteran Business must be certified by the Veteran’s Administration. ALCOSAN understands that the ability to use subconsultants will vary and depend greatly on the size and type of project. The Proposer shall describe its commitment to the policy, highlighting MBE/WBE/SDV participation rates on the Proposer’s past projects. The Proposer should identify potential team members, if any, proposed under this project and integrate the firms into the project. Failure to provide a clear MBE/WBE/SDV team structure where the team members are integrated into the program will impact a submittal’s evaluation. G. Potential Conflict of Interest (Tabbed Section 5): There are several Consultants who may be precluded, based upon their role in either the Preliminary Planning and/or the Program Manager for Tunnel. Each team member shall submit a Certificate of Conflict of Interest (See https://www.alcosan.org/work-with- us/standard-forms). Should a firm be unsure if the scope of work performed could be a potential conflict of interest, said firm shall notify the ALCOSAN 8 Procurement Officer for a decision on the potential conflict. The Proposer should pay particular attention to affiliate activities. H. Right to Know (Tabbed Section 6): ALCOSAN is a municipal authority and is therefore subject to requests through the Pennsylvania Right-To-Know Law (RTKL). Submittals may become part of a RTKL request during and after the subsequent contract. All Proposers shall clearly identify only that portion of the proposal, which is considered company proprietary information and, therefore, exempt under the RTKL. A legend at the beginning of the proposal and/or on every page will not be considered sufficient. If there is no information contained in the submittal that may be exempt from the RTKL, Proposers shall make a statement to that fact in the Submittal."," Description : ALCOSAN is soliciting Letters of Interest and Statements of Qualification (collectively, “Submittals”) from Professional Engineering firms to perform the Ohio River Tunnel (ORT) Final Design Consulting (FDC) Services.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

All proposals will be reviewed and ranked by a County staff team. Proposals will be scored according to the Scoring Guidelines shown in Table 2 of this RFP. Proposal Format: In order to ensure consistent evaluation of proposal, each proposal must be prepared in accordance with the guidelines provided below. A proposal must include the following six sections in the following order: 1) COVER LETTER/OWNER QUALIFICATIONS 2) LOCATION SUMMARY 3) BUSINESS AND OPERATION PLAN a. Business Plan b. Site Plan c. Operation Plan d. Satellite Site Map RFP #002-21 5 4) Proposed Industrial Hemp clone cultivar to be used 5) Water Source to be used for cultivation 6) Contract to sell harvest or intent for harvested hemp 7) Pest Management Plan 8) Pollen Management Plan Instructions for Preparing Proposals: 1) Cover letter/Owner Qualification All proposals must include a cover letter that provides the following information: A description of the business and cultivator qualification in production agriculture. 2) Location Summary Using GPS Coordinates, County APN Number, cultivation site address, provide a description of the proposed business location in terms of its surroundings, access, neighborhood characteristics as well as a summary of the appropriateness of the location. The summary should identify the nearest sensitive sites such as schools or parks. 3) Business and Operation Plan The Business Plan should include the proposed clone cultivar to be planted, the source and the amount of acreage to be planted. The water source(s) to be used for irrigation. The information on the contract to sell harvest or intentions of the harvested hemp and any other information describing the security and responsible operation plans of the cultivator with regard to adjacent production agriculture. 4) Pest Management Plan A Pest Management Plan is an essential to the pilot program to document how the cultivator will confront a pest issue on the hemp. The use of cultural practices and biological control help to mitigate the use approved chemical pesticides. The thoroughness of an applicant’s pest management strategy will document the experience and determination of the cultivator to grow hemp in a responsible manner. 5) Pollen Management Plan In order for Industrial Hemp to be successfully grown for CBD production and for Industrial Hemp cultivators to cultivate near to legal cannabis cultivators, it is essential that the Industrial Hemp Cultivator implement a rigorous Pollen Management Plan to avoid any males in the cultivation site. An applicant must demonstrate their strategy to prevent any male hemp plants from growing in the fields thus preventing pollen from being produced. Pollen in the Industrial Hemp setting can be considered a nuisance and may constitute a violation and possible proposed action and destruction. It is imperative that the cultivator be extremely vigilant of male production and demonstrate to the County staff a RFP #002-21 6 comprehensive strategy on how they will prevent males in the cultivation or rogue males that may be found. Section 4: Scoring and Selection Process The County staff team will use the criteria detailed in the table below to evaluate, score and rank proposals. To be considered eligible to be invited a minimum score of 12 points. Criteria Maximum score 22 Actual score Distance from permitted cannabis 3 Quality of surrounding buffers 3 Established Water Rights 3 California permitted operator 2 Pest management plan 2 Pollen management Plan 4 Total Score 17 0 Scoring Criteria Explanations: Distance from permitted cannabis (pollen): (Distance in miles)Distance from an applicant’s property to that of a permitted cannabis property will be considered weighted scoring criteria. The greater the distance an applicant’s hemp cultivation site to the closest property line of a permitted cannabis site, the more points the applicant will earn. The purpose of this weighted scoring system is to put as much distance between the hemp cultivation and a permitted cannabis to prevent accidental cross-pollination to either crop. Quality of surrounding buffers: Quality of surrounding buffers adjacent to a hemp cultivation will be considered weighted scoring criteria. This is cross-pollination prevention measure that the applicant must consider when planting in proximity to a permitted cannabis site. The quality and quantity of buffers that applicant chooses to put between their hemp cultivation and a permitted cannabis property, the higher the score the applicant will receive. Water Source: RFP #002-21 7 The reliability of the water source to irrigate the hemp cultivation will be considered weighted scoring criteria. It is critical that an applicant have a source of water that will irrigate the hemp throughout the growing season with no threat of running low or out of water. Municipal water sources or districts, well water, river-draft, approved spring or trucked-in water will vary in scoring weight. California Permitted Operator: A California Permitted operator will be considered weighted scoring criteria. The purpose of this criterion is to rate experience of a cultivator and their knowledge of production agriculture based on years of experience. An applicant must verify how many years they have held a California Operator Identification Permit or been registered in a verified Cannabis Program. Pest Management Plan: A pest management plan will be considered weighted scoring criteria. During the mandatory applicant interview, the applicant must explain to the interview team their strategy to combat any type of pest they may encounter during the hemp cultivation season. The applicant must present an Integrated Management Plan and its individual components in detail. Pollen Management Plan: A Pollen management plan will be considered weighted scoring criteria. The purpose of the Industrial Hemp Pilot Program is to demonstrate the ability to effectively and successfully cultivate Industrial Hemp in proximity to a permitted cannabis cultivation without cross-pollination. Applicants must demonstrate a method and a plan to avoid any male plants or hermaphrodite- clones from growing in the hemp field. The amount of time and method of inspections the applicant choses to schedule to keep males from growing in the hemp field will determine a score. A total score of 17 points is possible. The score needed for an applicant to be invited to the pilot program is 12 points, which is a score that is approximately 70%.","  This Request for Proposal (RFP) announces the intent of the County of Mendocino to implement an Industrial Hemp Pilot Program that regulates the cultivation of Industrial Hemp in a responsible manner to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of Mendocino County and to enforce rules and regulations consistent with the Mendocino County Industrial Hemp Ordinance Chapter 10A.18. The Mendocino County Ordinance is a pilot program that will run two years.

This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

COMPLETION & CERTIFICATION The person(s) completing the questionnaire must be knowledgeable about the vendor’s business and operations. An owner or officer must certify the questionnaire and the signature must be notarized. NEW YORK STATE VENDOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VENDOR ID) The Vendor ID is a ten-digit identifier issued by New York State when the vendor is registered on the Statewide Vendor File. This number must now be included on the questionnaire. If the business entity has not obtained a Vendor ID, contact the OSC Help Desk at ciohelpdesk@osc.state.ny.us or call 866-370-4672. DEFINITIONS All underlined terms are defined in the “New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List,” found at www.osc.state.ny.us/vendrep/documents/questionnaire/definitions.pdf. These terms may not have their ordinary, common or traditional meanings. Each vendor is strongly encouraged to read the respective definitions for any and all underlined terms. By submitting this questionnaire, the vendor agrees to be bound by the terms as defined in the ""New York State Vendor Responsibility Definitions List"" existing at the time of certification. RESPONSES Every question must be answered. Each response must provide all relevant information which can be obtained within the limits of the law. However, information regarding a determination or finding made in error which was subsequently corrected is not required. Individuals and Sole Proprietors may use a Social Security Number but are encouraged to obtain and use a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). REPORTING ENTITY Each vendor must indicate if the questionnaire is filed on behalf of the entire Legal Business Entity or an Organizational Unit within or operating under the authority of the Legal Business Entity and having the same EIN. Generally, the Organizational Unit option may be appropriate for a vendor that meets the definition of “Reporting Entity” but due to the size and complexity of the Legal Business Entity, is best able to provide the required information for the Organizational Unit, while providing more limited information for other parts of the Legal Business Entity and Associated Entities. ASSOCIATED ENTITY An Associated Entity is one that owns or controls the Reporting Entity or any entity owned or controlled by the Reporting Entity. However, the term Associated Entity does not include “sibling organizations” (i.e., entities owned or controlled by a parent company that owns or controls the Reporting Entity), unless such sibling entity has a direct relationship with or impact on the Reporting Entity. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is organized into eleven sections. Section I is to be completed for the Legal Business Entity. Section II requires the vendor to specify the Reporting Entity for the questionnaire. Section III refers to the individuals of the Reporting Entity, while Sections IV-VIII require information about the Reporting Entity. Section IX pertains to any Associated Entities, with one question about their Officials/Owners. Section X relates to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Section XI requires an authorized contact for the questionnaire information.

The existing 36-inch pipe will be repurposed to convey PennDOT drainage from 8th street to the large stone pipe on 6th Street. Additionally, the contract will require connection of a short segment of sewer on the south side of street to the newly laid 18-inch sewer pipe across the 60-inch PWSA waterline that occupies Clay Street.

This Addendum modifies the original plans and specifications as described below. INQUIRIES AND CLARIFICATIONS TO PROJECT PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS 1. Q: Project plans and specifications do not provide parameters for shut downs required to transfer power from the existing UPS to the new UPS system. What are the project requirements for notification and duration of the system shut down? A: It is incumbent on the contractor to plan and schedule the work to minimize the interruption of power to the county’s interagency emergency response system equipment. • Prior to starting any work on site, the contractor shall provide a detailed schedule of work tasks to complete the UPS replacement including procurement, and all change- over tasks. No work shall start until approved by the County. • The contractor shall provide at least 48 hours’ notice to the County prior to any interruption of service to permit notification of other agencies and proper shut down of equipment. • Complete installation of all raceways, panels, junction boxes, conductors and connected equipment that can be completed prior to change over. • It is acceptable to provide bypass connection for the server equipment directly from service panel during the installation. Duration of the bypass without UPS back-up may not exceed 3 days. • In no instance shall any individual interruption exceed 4 hours. 2. Q: Instructions to Bidders Section 00100 – Item 1.8 shows the time of completion to be “thirty (60) calendar days” May we assume that, as stated elsewhere, the intention is 60 days? A: Yes, the time of completion for the project is 60 calendar days. 3. Q: Will we be required to provide a cord set and ends for the generator connection to the CamLocks? A: Yes furnish and install 30’ of #2/0 five conductor cables and twist lock fittings (black blue, red, white and green) to connect the new CamLocks to a portable generator; strip and braise generator ends of the cables.

A: Yes, Keynote 7 should point to the CamLock panel, and Keynote 8 should point to the double throw switch. 5. Q: Plan sheet E-101 shows the 4” feeder conduit mounted on the exterior wall from the double throw switch to the CamLock panel. This will obscure the fixed window over the door. Is that the intent? A: Install the 4” feeder conduit tight to the roof beams to minimize the obstruction of the window. 6. Q: Galvanized Rigid Steel conduit is required by spec at all locations exposed to the weather, can we use EMT conduit with water tight fittings between the double throw switch and the CamLock panel? A: Specification Section 260533 Raceways and Boxes Part 3.3 items O, P, Q and R define the conditions under which different types of conduits may be used. Specifically Item P.1. states “Intermediate steel conduit may be installed in lieu of galvanized rigid steel conduit in all above ground areas where rigid steel is permitted, except for wires over 600- volts..” ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Attached is the mandatory pre-bid walk-through attendance sheet for this project.
